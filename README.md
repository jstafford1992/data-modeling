# data-modeling

## Standards Supported:
- Design and implement schemas

## Objectives:
- Define schema, entity, field, record, primary key, and foreign key
- List five data types
- Create ERDs to describe models, their fields, and relationships

## Definitions
- Schema
```
A database schema is the skeleton structure that represents the logical view of the entire database. It defines how the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated. It formulates all the constraints that are to be applied on the data.
```
- Entity
```
An entity is some unit of data that can be classified and have stated relationships to other entities
```
- Field
```
A field is the basic unit of data entry in a record.
```
- Record
```
Records are composed of fields, each of which contains one item of information.
```
- Primary key
```
A primary key is a special relational database table column (or combination of columns) designated to uniquely identify all table records. 
```
- Foreign key
```
In the context of relational databases, a foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. In simpler words, the foreign key is defined in a second table, but it refers to the primary key in the first table.
